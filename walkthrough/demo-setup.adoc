= Serverless Demo: Setup

:imagesdir: images

[TIP]
.On watching operator install progress
====
Open a new terminal and start a watch on the command oc get csv -n openshift-operators. For further reference in the setup we will call this terminal as WATCH_WINDOW.

----
watch 'oc get csv -ocustom-columns-file=$DEMO_HOME/install/csv-columns.txt -n openshift-operators' 
----

====

== Setup Prerequisites

Run the folloing commands in a shell
----
git clone https://github.com/hatmarch/serverless-demo.git
cd serverless-demo
export DEMO_HOME=$(pwd)

# ensure we have access to the stack that can build the app for .devcontainer
docker login registry.redhat.io
code .
----

* Make sure you have a user1-cloudnativeapps namespace
----
oc new-project user1-cloudnativeapps
----

IMPORTANT: When you run commands within the VSCode bash window, make sure you setup DEMO_HOME environment variable in each shell

== Operator Prerequisites

Make sure to subscribe to the necessary channels using these commands

----
oc apply -f "$DEMO_HOME/install/redhat-operators-csc.yaml" \
  -f "$DEMO_HOME/install/community-operators-csc.yaml"

oc -n openshift-marketplace get csc
----

A successful reconciliation should show an output like:

----
NAME                           STATUS      MESSAGE                                       AGE
community-operators-packages   Succeeded   The object has been successfully reconciled   62s
redhat-operators-packages      Succeeded   The object has been successfully reconciled   62s
----

== Installing Kafka 

=== Installing Kafka Operator
* Subscribe to the AMQ Streams Operator in the user1-cloudnativeapps namespace
----
oc apply -f $DEMO_HOME/install/kafka/subscription.yaml
----

Use the WATCH_WINDOW to look for the following output

----
NAME                VERSION   PHASE
amqstreams.v1.3.0   1.3.0     Succeeded
----

=== Installing Kafka in the namespace

* Install the kafka queues and two topics

----
oc apply -f $DEMO_HOME/install/kafka/kafka.yaml
oc apply -f $DEMO_HOME/install/kafka/kafka-order-topic.yaml 
oc apply -f $DEMO_HOME/install/kafka/kafka-payment-topic.yaml 
----

Kafka is installed once you see the following pods
----
my-cluster-kafka-0                                    2/2     Running     0          94s
my-cluster-kafka-1                                    2/2     Running     0          94s
my-cluster-kafka-2                                    2/2     Running     0          94s
my-cluster-zookeeper-0                                2/2     Running     0          4m13s
my-cluster-zookeeper-1                                2/2     Running     0          4m13s
my-cluster-zookeeper-2                                2/2     Running     0          4m12s
----

== Optional: Installing Service Mesh

NOTE: _Since the advent of OpenShift Serverless, it looks like setting up Istio separately is no longer required.  See also Kamesh's guide link:https://redhat-developer-demos.github.io/knative-tutorial/knative-tutorial-basics/0.7.x/01-setup.html#download-tutorial-sources[here] for another take on setup steps._

First setup Istio by creating the istio project and installing the operators

----
oc adm new-project istio-system 
oc apply -f "$DEMO_HOME/install/servicemesh/subscription.yaml"
----

The servicemesh operator needs to be _copied to the *istio-system* project_ before we can create a ServiceMeshControlPlane and ServiceMeshMemberRoll custom resources, you can adapt the WATCH_WINDOW commmand to look at the istio-system namespace as so

----
watch 'oc get csv -n istio-system -ocustom-columns-file=$DEMO_HOME/install/csv-columns.txt'
----

A successful servicemesh subscription install should show the output in WATCH_WINDOW like:

----
NAME                                         VERSION               PHASE
elasticsearch-operator.4.1.20-201910102034   4.1.20-201910102034   Succeeded
jaeger-operator.v1.13.1                      1.13.1                Succeeded
kiali-operator.v1.0.6                        1.0.6                 Succeeded
servicemeshoperator.v1.0.1                   1.0.1                 Succeeded
----

Once the operators are ready in the istio-system project, you can startup the servicemesh by creating a mesh and a memberroll.

----
oc create -f "$DEMO_HOME/install/servicemesh/smcp.yaml" && \
oc create -f "$DEMO_HOME/install/servicemesh/smmr.yaml"
----

It will take few minutes for the servicemesh components to be installed, you can watch the status using the command:

----
oc get pods -n istio-system -w
----

A successful servicemesh install should show the following pods:

----
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cluster-local-gateway-7795cc7956-mqmq7   1/1     Running   0          92s
istio-citadel-f88bdd688-c52z8            1/1     Running   0          2m58s
istio-galley-f8f96c6bf-x7f4k             1/1     Running   0          2m48s
istio-ingressgateway-65bf84457c-7rh5t    1/1     Running   0          92s
istio-pilot-7f57f8bb5b-cr2qr             1/1     Running   0          110s
----

WARNING: Installing Service Mesh and adding user1-cloudnativeapp to the service mesh might add a network policy that causes the routes to fail.  Delete this network policy to retore routes.

== Installing Serverless 

=== Installing Serving Operator

Install knative serving.  First subscribe

----
oc adm new-project knative-serving
oc apply -f "$DEMO_HOME/install/knative-serving/subscription.yaml" 
----

The serverless operator needs to be _copied to the *knative-serving* project_ before we can create a ServiceMeshControlPlane and ServiceMeshMemberRoll custom resources, you can adapt the WATCH_WINDOW commmand to look at the knative-serving namespace as so

----
watch oc get csv -n knative-serving -ocustom-columns-file=$DEMO_HOME/install/csv-columns.txt
----

Successful execution will look like this:

----
NAME                                        VERSION              PHASE
elasticsearch-operator.4.2.8-201911190952   4.2.8-201911190952   Succeeded
jaeger-operator.v1.13.1                     1.13.1               Succeeded
kiali-operator.v1.0.7                       1.0.7                Succeeded
serverless-operator.v1.2.0                  1.2.0                Succeeded
servicemeshoperator.v1.0.2                  1.0.2                Succeeded
----

=== Installing Knative Serving Instance

Only when that's done can you configure knative serving

----
oc apply -f "$DEMO_HOME/install/knative-serving/cr.yaml" -n knative-serving

oc get pods -n knative-serving -w
----

A successful serverless install will show the following pods in knative-serving namespace:

----
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
activator-dfb5b7b67-hh5kh           1/1     Running   0          79s
autoscaler-85bb4898c5-5sssb         1/1     Running   0          77s
autoscaler-hpa-865b6d49b7-7sqns     1/1     Running   0          78s
controller-65c8dd48d6-5cl9v         1/1     Running   0          73s
networking-istio-7c9fb7dd4c-lsbdm   1/1     Running   0          73s
webhook-95969d4fc-t9d4v             1/1     Running   0          72s
----

== Installing Knative Eventing

----
oc adm new-project knative-eventing
oc apply -f "$DEMO_HOME/install/knative-eventing/subscription.yaml"
----

The serverless operator needs to be _copied to the *knative-eventing* project_ before we can use it. You can adapt the WATCH_WINDOW commmand to look at the knative-serving namespace as so

----
watch 'oc get csv -n knative-eventing -ocustom-columns-file=$DEMO_HOME/install/csv-columns.txt'
----

A successful knative eventing subscription install should show the output in WATCH_WINDOW like:

----
NAME                                         VERSION               PHASE
elasticsearch-operator.4.1.20-201910102034   4.1.20-201910102034   Succeeded
jaeger-operator.v1.13.1                      1.13.1                Succeeded
kiali-operator.v1.0.6                        1.0.6                 Succeeded
knative-eventing-operator.v0.8.0             0.8.0                 Succeeded
serverless-operator.v1.0.0                   1.0.0                 Succeeded
servicemeshoperator.v1.0.1                   1.0.1                 Succeeded
----

Finally, check that the pods in the knative-serving namespace look like this

----
$ oc get pods -n knative-eventing
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
eventing-controller-5c7c649d4b-gf4v9   1/1     Running   0          7m11s
eventing-webhook-569c567bd5-wm5mk      1/1     Running   0          7m10s
imc-controller-7c9898558b-rkhtw        1/1     Running   0          7m4s
imc-dispatcher-cd5c98964-q94xd         1/1     Running   0          7m4s
sources-controller-5b86d684fb-252sd    1/1     Running   0          7m10s
----

== Installing Knative Kafka Eventing

First subscribe to the operator

----
oc apply -f "$DEMO_HOME/install/kafka-eventing/subscription.yaml"
----

This can also be done manually.  In user1-cloudnativeapps go to *Operators > Operator Hub* to find it

image:kafka-event-operator.png[]

Then install the operator with the default values (e.g. across whole cluster)

Use the WATCH_WINDOW with this command:
----
watch 'oc get csv -n user1-cloudnativeapps -ocustom-columns-file=$DEMO_HOME/install/csv-columns.txt'
----

and wait until you see:

----
NAME                                        VERSION              PHASE
amqstreams.v1.3.0                           1.3.0                Succeeded
elasticsearch-operator.4.2.8-201911190952   4.2.8-201911190952   Succeeded
jaeger-operator.v1.13.1                     1.13.1               Succeeded
kiali-operator.v1.0.7                       1.0.7                Succeeded
knative-kafka-operator.v0.9.0               0.9.0                Succeeded
serverless-operator.v1.2.0                  1.2.0                Succeeded
servicemeshoperator.v1.0.2                  1.0.2                Succeeded
